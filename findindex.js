/*First sort the array in ascending order, this is currently done using array functions for minimal footprint.
Once the array is sorted, we directly apply the .findIndex() where we are going to compare every element in the array 
until we find where num <= currNum - where the number we want to insert is less than or equal to the current number in the iteration.
Then we use ternary operations to check whether we got an index returned or -1. 
We only get -1 when the index was not found, meaning when we get a false for all elements in the array, 
and for such case, it would mean that num should be inserted at the end of the list. 
Hence, why we use arr.length.*/
